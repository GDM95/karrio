# Getting Started with Karrio for Shipping Automation

Karrio is a modern shipping infrastructure that simplifies shipping operations for e-commerce businesses of all sizes. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basic steps to integrate Karrio into your existing e-commerce platform.

## What is Karrio?

Karrio is an open-source multi-carrier shipping API that allows you to connect with multiple shipping carriers through a single, unified API. Instead of integrating with each carrier separately, you can use Karrio to:

- Get shipping rates from multiple carriers
- Create shipping labels
- Track shipments
- Validate addresses
- And much more!

## Setting up Karrio

### Installation

The easiest way to get started with Karrio is through our Docker installation:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -d karrio/karrio
```

For more advanced configurations, including self-hosting options, check out our [self-hosting documentation](/docs/self-hosting).

### API Integration

Once Karrio is running, you can integrate it with your application using our REST API or one of our client libraries:

```javascript
// Example using the JavaScript client
import { Karrio } from '@karrio/client';

const karrio = new Karrio({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key',
  server: 'http://localhost:8000'
});

// Get shipping rates
const rates = await karrio.rating.fetch({
  shipper: {
    postal_code: '12345',
    country_code: 'US'
  },
  recipient: {
    postal_code: '54321',
    country_code: 'US'
  },
  parcels: [{
    weight: 1.0,
    weight_unit: 'LB'
  }]
});
```

## Next Steps
