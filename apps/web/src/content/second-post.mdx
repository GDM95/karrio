## What is Karrio?

Karrio is a powerful, flexible shipping API that connects your application to multiple shipping carriers through a unified interface. It eliminates the complexity of integrating with different carrier APIs by providing a standardized way to:

- Rate shipments
- Create labels
- Track packages
- Manage pickups
- And much more!

## Installation

Getting Karrio up and running is straightforward. You can use Docker for the quickest setup:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Or install it directly using pip:

```python
pip install karrio
```

## Basic Usage Example

Here's a simple example of creating a shipment with Karrio:

```javascript
import { Karrio } from '@karrio/client';

const karrio = new Karrio({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
});

async function createShipment() {
  const shipment = await karrio.shipments.create({
    carrier: 'ups',
    service: 'express',
    shipper: {
      name: 'Sender Name',
      address: {
        street: '123 Shipping St',
        city: 'Shipville',
        postalCode: '12345',
        country: 'US',
      },
    },
    recipient: {
      name: 'Receiver Name',
      address: {
        street: '456 Delivery Ave',
        city: 'Receiverton',
        postalCode: '67890',
        country: 'US',
      },
    },
    parcels: [{
      weight: 2.0,
      weightUnit: 'KG',
      dimensions: {
        length: 20,
        width: 15,
        height: 10,
        unit: 'CM',
      },
    }],
  });

  console.log('Shipment created:', shipment);
  return shipment;
}
```

## Integration Tips

When integrating Karrio into your application, keep these best practices in mind:

1. **Store API credentials securely** - Never expose your API keys in client-side code
2. **Implement error handling** - Shipping APIs can fail for various reasons
3. **Cache rate quotes** - To improve performance and reduce API calls
4. **Test with sandbox environments** - Before going to production

## Advanced Features

Karrio offers many advanced features that you can explore as you become more familiar with the platform:

- **Batch processing** for handling multiple shipments
- **Custom label formats** to match your branding
- **Webhook notifications** for tracking updates
- **Analytics dashboard** for shipping insights
